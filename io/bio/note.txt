bio: The best explaintion: stands for the loacation in memory and on the device 
	1188  * submit_bio_noacct - re-submit a bio to the block device layer for I/O
	1189  * @bio:  The bio describing the location in memory and on the device.

	bio can be merged into a request, or allocate a new request for the bio.

request:  The block layer allocate request to let the driver device handle it.
	  All the bioes in the request are a phythic continous disk sector.

          request may not be queued directly to hardware if:
          1. This request can be merged with another one
          2. We want to place request at plug queue for possible future merging
          3. There is an IO scheduler active at this queue

2126  * blk_mq_submit_bio - Create and send a request to block device.
2127  * @bio: Bio pointer.
2128  *
2129  * Builds up a request structure from @q and @bio and send to the device. The
2130  * request may not be queued directly to hardware if:
2131  * * This request can be merged with another one
2132  * * We want to place request at plug queue for possible future merging
2133  * * There is an IO scheduler active at this queue
